# rhoReactingPimpleFoam

An [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) solver that combines rhoPimpleFoam and rhoReactingFoam for high-speed reactive flows.

It has been tested with OpenFOAM v8 and for supersonic flows in vacuum with mixing
of different gases. A minimal example can be found in the examples directory.
